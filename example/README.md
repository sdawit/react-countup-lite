# Example for react-countup-lite

This folder contains a simple React app to test and demonstrate the features of `react-countup-lite`.

## How to run

1. Make sure you have installed all dependencies in the root project:

   ```sh
   yarn install
   # or
   npm install
   ```

2. Build the library (if needed):

   ```sh
   yarn build
   # or
   npm run build
   ```

3. Start a dev server in the `example` folder. You can use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) or [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) for quick prototyping:

   ```sh
   cd example
   npx vite
   # or
   npx parcel index.html
   ```

4. Open your browser to the provided local URL (usually http://localhost:5173 or http://localhost:1234).

## Notes

- This example directly imports from the `src` folder for rapid development. For production usage, import from the built package.
